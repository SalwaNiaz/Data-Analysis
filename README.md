# Analysis of Shall-Issue Laws on Crime Rates
# This analysis investigates the impact of "shall-issue" concealed guns carry laws on crime 
rates across U.S. states from 1977 to 1999. "Shall-issue" laws require authorities to issue concealed weapons
carry permits to applicants who meet specific criteria, thereby standardizing the permitting 
process. 
#The primary objective is to determine whether the enactment of these laws correlates with 
reductions in violent crimes, such as murder and robbery
